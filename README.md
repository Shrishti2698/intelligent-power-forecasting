## ðŸš€ How to Build & Run the Project (Locally)

### 1. Prerequisites

* Docker Desktop installed and running: [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* Python 3.10+ (for backend model testing if needed)
* Internet connection (required on first run to fetch model from Google Drive)

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shrishti2698/intelligent-power-forecasting.git
cd intelligent-power-forecasting
```

---

### 3. Start the Full Stack App with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

* This command will:

  * Download the required backend model from Google Drive (if not already cached)
  * Spin up FastAPI backend on port `8000`
  * Launch React frontend via `nginx` on port `3000`

---

### 4. Access the Application

* Frontend (Dashboard): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend API (Swagger Docs): [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## ðŸ“† Model Hosting (Google Drive)

Due to GitHub's 100MB size limit, the trained ML model is hosted externally and fetched at runtime. It will be downloaded automatically when the backend starts.

**Download link (used internally):**

```
https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1T3UXUCx0_IPS3vNB5I_Akvt2qC3Dv1bl
```

You don't need to manually upload or place `model.pkl` inside the repo.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

* Forecast next **24 hours** (96 blocks) of electricity demand
* Real-time data visualization using **Chart.js**
* Integrated **weather and holiday data** for improved accuracy
* **Responsive frontend** built with React
* **Interactive API documentation** via Swagger UI
* **Fully Dockerized** project
